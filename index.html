                <h2>You Decide the Action</h2>
                <p>Explore the lands of the Mist Wind Coast, meet exotic 
                    people and take the course of action you want to find
                    clues and gather items to solve the riddles. As you
                    add experience, increase your combat capabilities

                <h2>Creative scenario</h2>
                <p>No dice rolling. A combat system where you pay 
                    attention to the monster's moves and change your 
                    style of attack to dodge their clutching claws 
                    and hammer home a hit.

                    You solve the puzzles, you unearth the mysteries, you save the day.

                    Not your average talking game . Esmerelda needs no training, and
                    arrives equipped to engage your game play. She pays attention 
                    when you talk, compliments you on good decisions and encourages
                    you. She is even impressed when you answer a difficult riddle 
                    or defeat a deadly dungeon denizen.</p>
